<p>I had a look into this and followed the instructions using GPG Suite for Mac. I also noticed a slightly different output, but I suspect this depends on the GPG software you use, because my output was also different to yours. I don’t think the risk of confusion to users is too great, so I would recommend we keep the output as it is.</p>
<p>As for step 11 in https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account, the UI has indeed changed. I think we should update as follows:
- Before step 4, add a new step saying: <code>In the \"Title\" field, type a name for your GPG key.</code>
- In step 4, remove the screenshot, as this is not a difficult field for the user to find.
- Also remove the screenshot in step 5.
- Change step 6 to <code>To confirm the action, authenticate to your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account.</code></p>
<p>I’ll add the <code>help wanted</code> label to this issue, and you or anyone else is welcome to create a PR to make the fix outlined above 🚀</p>
<h4 id="original-post">Original post</h4>
<p>Step 11 lists an example output of the <code>gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long</code> shell command.</p>
<p>This output, however, seems to no longer be completely accurate, at least when using Gpg4win as the GPG software.</p>
<p>The command now outputs the following (I’m using wrong characters to avoid any accidental matches):</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>$ gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
/c/Users/Someone/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
-----------------------------------
sec   rsa4096/=ABCD1234ABCD123 2023-02-22 [SC]
      =ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD123
uid                 [ultimate] Someone (A GPG Key) &lt;someone@example.com&gt;
ssb   rsa4096/4321DCBA4321DCBA 2023-02-22 [E]</code></pre>
<p>The above also applies to the example in https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key</p>
<hr />
<p>https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account</p>
<p>Step 4 displays an outdated image. The current modal is having a "Title" summary field which the screenshot is not displaying.</p>
<p>Additionally does step 6 only mention to "enter your GitHub password" while Users with GitHub Mobile may use the app to authorize the action.</p>

<p>After following the directions given in this section, to store the passphrase in keychain, I continued to be prompted for the passphrase on every <code>git push</code>. I am using MacOS 12.6.2.</p>
<p>After reading some forums on related issues on recent MacOS versions, I found that copying the command given at step 3(<code>ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_{% ifversion ghae %}rsa{% else %}ed25519{% endif %}</code>) into <code>~/.zshrc</code> gave correct behaviour.</p>
<p>Use case: Mac users encountering problems with SSH connections using a stored passphrase.</p>
<p>Expected outcome: a note to suggest a fix to this problem, if encountered.</p>
<p>I suggest adding to the note at step 3 that this extra step may be required, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you continue to be prompted for your passphrase, you may need to add the above command to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file (or <code>.bashrc</code> for bash).</p>

<p>There seems to be no documentation for what the GraphQL API returns on error conditions.</p>
<p>In particular, I can’t find what error code to expect once the rate limit is exceeded. I see I can use the <code>rateLimit</code> query field to get information on how many points I have left <em>when a query succeeds</em>, but I can’t rely on that alone as I might have a few points left and then make a very large request.</p>
<p>I assume a rate limit error will also provide a <code>resetAt</code> field, but I have no idea under what name or path. The only way I can see to develop an app that will handle rate limits gracefully is to burn 5000 points and hit the error to learn how it looks like.</p>

<p>I want to replicate exactly that. Multiple deploy actions which depends on a single build action in my case.</p>
<p>However, reading the article, I wasn’t able to find out how to share files across actions. The article ends with sharing strings only.</p>

<p>From my experience and others <a href="https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/issues/306">in this ticket</a>, it appears that AWS don’t currently support checking the various assertions that are passed through by GitHub e.g. repository_owner in my case. Their docs suggest otherwise, so it is probably a bug in AWS.</p>
<p>It might be worth highlighting in the docs, unless you have been able to get it to work yourselves.</p>
<p>Filtering on <code>sub</code> works fine.</p>

<p><code>GITHUB_REF</code> and <code>GITHUB_REF_NAME</code> show example values of <code>refs/heads/feature-branch-1</code> and <code>feature-branch-1</code> respectively. However this is inconsistent with the values populated in the case of a PR-triggered workflow.</p>
<p>Given the description and example, one would expect to see the branch that triggered the workflow when running a PR-triggered workflow. Instead these variables are populated by values like <code>refs/pull/26/merge</code> and <code>26/merge</code> respectively. The variable that contains the desired data in this case is actually <code>GITHUB_HEAD_REF</code>.</p>
<p>The documentation should be updated to more accurately describe the content of GitHub Actions predefined variables.</p>

<p>When OpenSSH is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">installed using the Settings</a> (Window 10 build 1809 and later; or Windows Server 2019), the <code>ssh-agent</code> runs as a background system service rather than returning a stringified batch script that needs to be <code>eval</code>’d.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18683092/how-to-run-ssh-add-on-windows#:~:text=Update%202019%20-%20A%20better%20solution%20if%20you%27re%20using%20Windows%2010%3A%20OpenSSH%20is%20available%20as%20part%20of%20Windows%2010%20which%20makes%20using%20SSH%20from%20cmd/powershell%20much%20easier%20in%20my%20opinion.%20It%20also%20doesn%27t%20rely%20on%20having%20git%20installed%2C%20unlike%20my%20previous%20solution.">2019 update to top answer on "How to run ssh-add on windows?"</a></p>
<p>This means that the status quo instructions promoting either <code>eval $(ssh-agent -s)</code> or <code>eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"</code> will not work for some users, but will also not provide useful output. For me, either above command does nothing in PowerShell or cmd.</p>
<h3 id="additional-information">Additional information</h3>
<p>A succinct emendation is to recommend <code>Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Get-Process</code> in a PowerShell host to find the <code>ssh-agent</code> process ID.</p>
<p>A more detailed suggestion is to walk the reader through scrupulously determining what is providing <code>ssh-agent</code>, if anything.</p>

1. I see the go bin has a main_test.go file, but I don’t see we call it during our action CI build
Note: <code>cd protoc-gen-twirp_ruby &amp;&amp; go test ./...</code> will execute the test
2. We could have a integration test, where from a .proto file we generate the stubs, and asserts against that, to prevent major breaking changes.
3. Idea: bring some of the example app as part of our test suite.</p>
<p>1 is a easy win, 2 and 3 are more like ideas, but the overall goal here is to have tests that trigger the protoc ruby bin.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Named model sample in Writing Queries page is incorrect</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.graphql.net/issues/196</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>The sample at the bottom of <a href="https://github.com/octokit/octokit.graphql.net/blob/master/docs/writing-queries.md">Writing Queries</a> is wrong. The syntax for creating a named object is different from anonymous objects. The following is a complete sample that works except I don’t know how to get the issues.</p>
<pre><code>class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        AsyncMethod().Wait();
    }

        var connection = new Connection(productInformation, \&quot;mytoken\&quot;);

        Octokit.GraphQL.Core.IQueryableValue&lt;RepositoryModel&gt; query = new Query()
            .Repository(\&quot;octokit.graphql.net\&quot;, \&quot;octokit\&quot;)
            .Select(r =&gt; new RepositoryModel
            {
                Name = r.Name,
                Description = r.Description,
                //Issues = r.Issues(100, null, null, null, null, null, null).Select(i =&gt; new IssueModel
                //{
                //    Number = i.Number,
                //    Title = i.Title,
                //}).ToList(),
            });
        try
        {
            RepositoryModel result = await connection.Run(query);
            if (result != null)
                Console.WriteLine(result.Name + \&quot; &amp; \&quot; + result.Description);
            else
                Console.WriteLine(\&quot;Null result\&quot;);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(\&quot;Error: {0}\&quot;, ex.Message);
            if (ex.InnerException != null)
                Console.WriteLine(\&quot;InnerException: {0}\&quot;, ex.InnerException.Message);
        }
    }
}

class RepositoryModel

}

class IssueModel
{
    public int Number { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
}</code></pre>
<p>A minor issue is that the Repository method arguments are reversed.</p>
<p>The important part that is incorrect is:</p>
<pre><code>r.Name,
r.Description,</code></pre>
<p>The problem with the issues is that Repository.Issues is an IssueConnection, right? I get the impression that the definition of issues has been (appropriately) made more complicated after the article was written.</p>
<p>Also, I avoid using <em>var</em> but fans of var can change that code if they feel it is necessary. I don’t think it will make a difference here.</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Support automatically getting rate limit information during a query</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.graphql.net/issues/192</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>When I was doing GitHub GraphQL queries manually, I would almost always write them like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode graphql"><code class="sourceCode graphql"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">query</span> {</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  rateLimit {</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    cost</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    remaining</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    resetAt</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  }</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  // The rest of my <span class="kw">query</span> ...</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That way, I could load the rate limit information directly without having to make separate queries to get it. Plus, every query would include the cost so that I could track that in my application. As far as I can tell, this is not possible in Octokit.GraphQL.Net. I think it would be a very valuable addition.</p>
<p>Ideally, I’d be able to add some configuration option in my query to indicate I want rate limit data (a boolean constructor arg on <code>Query</code> or an extension method of some kind) and the return value of the query would be augmented to be something like <code>QueryResult&lt;T&gt;</code> which exposes <code>T</code> as a property, as well as the rate limit data:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode csharp"><code class="sourceCode cs"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">var</span> query <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">new</span> <span class="fu">Query</span><span class="op">()</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">WithRateLimit</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="co">/* options like which rate limit fields to include */</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">Repository</span><span class="op">(...)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="co">// The rest of my query...</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dt">var</span> results <span class="op">=</span> await _connection<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">Run</span><span class="op">(</span>query<span class="op">);</span></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Console<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">WriteLine</span><span class="op">(</span>$\<span class="st">&quot;Rate Limit cost: {results.RateLimit.Cost}</span><span class="sc">\&quot;</span><span class="st">);</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Console<span class="op">.</span><span class="fu">WriteLine</span><span class="op">(</span>$\<span class="st">&quot;Results: {results.Data}</span><span class="sc">\&quot;</span><span class="st">); // &lt;-- The actual data returned by the query</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As far as I can tell, without a feature like this, it’s not really possible to get the "cost" of a GraphQL query, since that field only really works when attached to a query. I can only make separate queries for my remaining rate limit and the reset time.</p></pre> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>A long time ago, Python had its own bug database/git repository called BPO. Then they migrated to github. As part of the migration, they decided to not migrate their users and instead create "mannequin" accounts. Somehow this became a feature in GitHub: <a href="https://devguide.python.org/triage/github-bpo-faq/index.html#what-on-earth-is-a-mannequin">What on Earth is a “mannequin”?</a></p>
<p>We have a tool that uses octokit.net and looks through PRs/Issues. Our tool found a PR in the python/cpython repo, which was created by one of these mannequin accounts:
https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/50246</p>
<p>Octokit.net does not know how to deal with these as they don’t represent real users.</p>

<item>	<title>[FEAT]: PackageVersion has no tag reported for container type</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/2683</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>Hi guys,
Just to let you know, when calling for example Packages.PackageVersions.GetAllForOrg(owner, packageType, packageName) for a container type, we are getting the packages (PackageVersion type) but the Metadata is incomplete: Container section is not present and so Tags are also not present… we are getting only the package type as Metadata.
thus, it’s not easy to find a container from its tag.
I used the GetAllForOrg method but from what I saw in the code, all methods returning the PackageVersion should produce the same result.

<item>	<title>[FEAT]: Support partial string/id matches for issues and pull requests</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/2673</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="describe-the-need">Describe the need</h3>
<p>SearchIssuesRequest supports a "term" for requests:</p>
<pre><code>var term = \&quot;good\&quot;
var request = new SearchIssuesRequest(term);</code></pre>
<p>If I send the request for a repo with issue #1 titled "goodbye", no results will be returned. I’ve attempted to play with wildcard (e.g. "good*") but haven’t been able to find a way to retrieve partial match results.</p>
<p>The same applies to partial id matches.</p>
<p>var term = "1"
var request = new SearchIssuesRequest(term);</p>
<p>If I send this request to a repo that has issues 1, 12, and 111, only 1 will be retrieved as a result.</p>
<p>Please let me know if partial matches are supported and I’m missing something here!</p>

<item>	<title>[BUG]: .NET 7.0 causes ArgumentException in client.Repository.Content.DeleteFile</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/2659</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>Using client.Repository.Content.DeleteFile(org, repo, filePath, DeleteFileRequest) of GitHubClient throws an ArgumentException - The value cannot be null or empty. (Parameter ‘mediaType’) when invoked in an application compiled using .Net 7.0. This previously worked in .Net 6.0 (I verified that simply reverting my project back to 6.0 resolves the issue with all 3 of the following versions of Ocotkit.net Octokit.net 4.0.0, 4.0.3, 4.0.4).</p>
<p>Background: We identified an issue in our application where a function that had previously worked was now failing and upon looking into the logs found the exception: System.ArgumentException: The value cannot be null or empty. (Parameter ‘mediaType’). After some digging, realizing that our code had not changed we began looking into what had and found that we had recently upgraded to .Net 7.0 and Octokit 4.0.3. We tried rolling back the Octokit change and upgrading to the latest version and then reverted to .Net 6.0 which solved the issue.</p>
<p>I have put together a sample application that demonstrates this behavior here: https://github.com/DotNet-Ninja/SampleRepository that you can use to replicate the issue. There are instructions/details in the readme file in that repo as far as how to set up the project and replicate the issue.</p>

<item>	<title>How to fetch a commit's content?</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/2644</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>Hey people,</p>
<p>I wonder if there is a way to fetch the contents of a large repository/commit, without exceeding the api rate-limit? Bonus question: Is there also a way to fetch only the content of a tree or sub-tree without exceeding the api rate-limit?</p>
<p>Thank you</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>[BUG]: Accessing renamed repositories from an app installation</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/2627</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-happened">What happened?</h3>
<p>We’re trying to read an issue from a repository, that has previously been renamed.</p>
<p>With the new name:</p>
<pre><code>var issue = client.Issue.Get(\&quot;owner\&quot;, \&quot;newName\&quot;, 1).Result;</code></pre>
<p>This works as expected.</p>
<p>With the old name:</p>
<pre><code>var issue = client.Issue.Get(\&quot;owner\&quot;, \&quot;oldName\&quot;, 1).Result;</code></pre>
<p>The program just hangs at this line (or continues and exits when using async/await).</p>
<p>The docs state, that redirects are followed, but this doesn’t seem to be the case here. It is very confusing, as no exceptions are thrown, and it just hangs/exits without any error code.</p>

<item>	<title>Support deserializing C# record types</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/2431</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><h3 id="what-you-were-trying-to-do.">What you were trying to do.</h3>
<p>I was trying to call <code>IGitHubClient.Connection.Get&lt;T&gt;()</code> where <code>T</code> is a C# record type</p>
<h3 id="what-you-expected-to-happen.">What you expected to happen.</h3>
<p>That method to return an object</p>
<h3 id="what-actually-happened.">What actually happened.</h3>
<p>A <code>System.NullReferenceException</code> was thrown</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-reproduce-the-problem.">Steps to reproduce the problem.</h3>
<p>I defined the record types:</p>
<pre><code>private sealed record RunnerListResponse(List&lt;RunnerInfo&gt; runners);
private sealed record RunnerInfo(int id, string name, string status, string os, bool busy, List&lt;RunnerLabel&gt; labels);
private sealed record RunnerLabel(int id, string name, string type);</code></pre>
<p>then I made the call:</p>
<pre><code>IApiResponse&lt;RunnerListResponse&gt; runnerListResponse = await m_github.Connection.Get&lt;RunnerListResponse&gt;(
    new Uri( \&quot;/enterprises/xxx/actions/runners\&quot;, UriKind.Relative ),
    parameters: new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; {
        { \&quot;per_page\&quot;, \&quot;100\&quot; }
    },
    accepts: \&quot;application/vnd.github.v3+json\&quot;
);</code></pre>
<p>Note that System.Text.Json does support record types. I can work around this issue with the following call:</p>
<pre><code>IApiResponse&lt;byte[]&gt; rawResponse = await m_github.Connection.GetRaw(
    new Uri( m_githubRunnersRoute, UriKind.Relative ),
    parameters: new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; {
        { \&quot;per_page\&quot;, \&quot;100\&quot; }
    }
);
RunnerListResponse runnerResponse = System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;RunnerListResponse&gt;( (string)rawResponse.HttpResponse.Body );</code></pre>
<p>But I would very much prefer not to do this</p></pre> ]]></description>

<item>	<title>Support Etags</title>
	<link>https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/issues/352</link>
	<description><![CDATA[ <pre><p>GitHub API supports Etags! But Octokit.net does not.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw2.github.com/Haacked/gifs/master/sad/cute-sad.gif" /></p>
<p>We should support this! But it’s a teensy bit tricky. If we only support this at the <code>ApiConnection</code> or <code>Connection</code> level, then using Octokit becomes kind of a pain for everyone.</p>
<p>Ideally, it’s part of our top level api. But that poses a problem as well, do we just add an Etag property to the models? Then what do we do about cases like this?</p>
<pre><code>IObservable&lt;Repository&gt; GetRepositories();</code></pre>
<p>The ETag for that request (or set of requests) is for the list of repositories. Each individual repository won’t have an etag.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></pre> ]]></description>
